#### 解説・理由（番号付き）

1. **Math → math**
   教科名を一般名詞として使う場合は小文字が基本。大文字は固有名詞扱いになり不自然。
2. **of → at**
   *the teacher of my high school* は誤用。学校に所属する場合は *at* を使う。
3. **reason → reasons**
   *two* があるため、名詞は必ず複数形にする。
4. **was → is**
   現在も成り立つ内容なので、時制を現在形に統一する。
5. **for me → to me**
   *important* は *important to 人* が正しい語法。
   
   - **be important to + 人**
     - Studying English is important to me.
   - **be important for + 目的 / 結果 / 行為**
     - Practice is important for improving your English.
6. **teacher Math lessons → teacher's math lessons**
   所有関係は **’s** で表す。入試で頻出の減点ポイント。
7. **prepared hard → worked hard**
   *prepare hard* は不自然。努力を表す定型表現は *work hard*。
8. **him → his**
   *lessons* を修飾するため、代名詞は所有格を使う。
9. **ask → asks**
   主語が三人称単数（He）のため、動詞に *-s* が必要。
10. **help them learning → help them learn**
    *help + 目的語 + 動詞の原形* が基本構文。
11. **talked → talks**
    習慣・性格を述べる文なので現在形が適切。
12. **In this time → At that time**
    *in this time* は誤り。過去のある時点は *at that time*。
13. **very friendly → in a very friendly way**
    *friendly* は形容詞。動詞を修飾する場合は副詞的表現にする。
14. **helped me studying → helped me study**
    *help* の後は動詞の原形。動名詞は使えない。

#### 例文

<span class="imt4">

My favorite teacher was my high school math teacher. There are two reasons why he was so important to me.

First, he made math lessons very easy to understand. He prepared thoroughly for his classes and often asked students questions to help them learn.

Second, he talked with students a lot. During these conversations, we could ask him questions about math, and he would always answer in a very friendly way.

In fact, my math teacher helped me a great deal with my studies.
