##### なぜ修正が必要か

1. **単数・複数（reason / reasons）**  
   → 数が2つあるなら、名詞は必ず複数形にする。

2. **important for / to の違い**  
   → 人の気持ち・評価には **important to + 人** が基本。  

   - **be important to + 人**  
     - Studying English is important to me.
   - **be important for + 目的 / 結果 / 行為**  
     - Practice is important for improving your English.

3. **所有格（teacher’s）**  
   → 「先生の授業」は **’s** を使わないと意味が不自然。

4. **help + 動詞**  
   → help の後は **動詞の原形** を使うのが原則。

5. **friendly は形容詞**  
   → 動詞を修飾したいときは  
   **in a friendly way** や **kindly** を使う。

6. **時制の統一**  
   → 過去の話なら、動詞はすべて過去形にそろえる。
